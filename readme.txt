Import products into woocommerce.

== Description ==

Import and manage products in Woocommerce. Upload your CSV file, create your header and import. The import plugin uses AJAX to import the products. No more timeouts on big files. This plugin is tested to 10.000+ products.

First step is to look at your settings, select the right field separator and take a look at the other settings as well. 

When you have done that it's time to link the right columns to the right fields. Upload your CSV file in the header tab and link them. If the plugin can map the fields it will do so automatically.

When you have mapped the right fields, it is time to import!

= There are a few nice add-ons: =

1. Import variable products
2. Import attributes
3. Import custom fields
4. Import premium
5. import taxonomies

You can find them at [allaerd.org](http://allaerd.org/shop)

I do not answer questions on the forum anymore. If you have questions about the add-ons or the free importer, fill in my [contact form](http://allaerd.org/contact/). Before asking questions please read the [documentation](http://allaerd.org/documentation/).
